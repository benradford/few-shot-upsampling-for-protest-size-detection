The Lt. on the left said as much as they support their message - if officers walked with them it could make the protesters a target. pic.twitter.com/9uqJWMhobK\\n\\nWow, after 5 days of protests in the valley police did something I haven’t seen before.

       " 'text': 'PINCKNEYVILLE — Sophie Kelly wondered why no one in her hometown of Pinckneyville had planned a protest or rally to stand with the Black Lives Matter movement.\\n\\nSince George Floyd, a black man, died in Minneapolis Police custody on Memorial Day after a white police officer pressed his knee to Floyd\\'s neck for nearly nine minutes, protests have been held around the world, including in several small Southern Illinois towns like Anna, Benton and Carterville.\\n\\nKelly posed the question about a Pinckneyville rally on Facebook. Her friends Mikayla Rhienecker and Logan Wildermuth were considering organizing a rally there, too.\\n\\n“We felt like Pinckneyville needs a change. I’ve heard stories of people who are afraid to come to Pinckneyville,” Rhienecker said. “They call us the friendly little city, but we’re not really that friendly.”\\n\\nWildermuth decided he had to help his friends.\\n\\nThe three friends in Pinckneyville started planning. The friends, who are all white, got some negative comments on Facebook for “stealing the voice” of the community’s people of color.\\n\\nTory Woods, who is an African American employed by Perry County government, disagrees. She was one of nearly 100 people who gathered in Pinckneyville\\'s square Thursday afternoon for the Black Lives Matter rally.\\n\\n“They are not taking away a black person’s voice. They are stepping up to say these things are not OK,” Woods said.\\n\\nWoods has experienced racism at her job with the county. When a customer did not like an answer Woods gave her, she called Woods a racist slur, she said. A co-worker asked the customer to leave. Woods praised former County Board Chairman Jim Epplin for vowing that would not happen again.\\n\\nSupport Local Journalism\\n\\n“I’m a strong girl. I can handle it. My grandmother taught me to treat people by who they are (their character), not by the color of their skin,\" Woods said.\\n\\nWoods did not experience racism in her job with Illinois Department of Agriculture in Carbondale and Pinckneyville, she said. She said she doesn’t know why these kinds of incidents still happen in Pinckneyville, pointing out that Robert Spencer, the city’s African American mayor, was re-elected for a second term, which he is currently serving.\\n\\nRon Kreid carried a sign Thursday that read, “All lives matter. Jesus proved this almost 2,000 years ago. Jesus loves you and me.”\\n\\nHe said he wanted to tell protesters that there is a greater truth. Ron Kreid shouted “all lives matter,” “Jesus loves you and me,” “black lives matter” and other phrases using an electronic bullhorn. At times, it seemed like he was trying to drown out the group of protesters gathered across from Perry County Courthouse.\\n\\nKreid said he does not disagree that black lives matter, but stressed that the fact that Jesus can change the world is a greater truth. “The one true God can make a difference in the world. I have nothing against them,” he said.\\n\\n“Why say all lives matter when black lives are being attacked?” Woods asked. “I want to see us grow and become one. Let’s all come together and support one another.”\\n\\nKreid’s shouting upset several protesters and made 11-year-old Jacelyn, who did not give her last name, feel very angry.\\n\\n“We’re not protesting all lives. We want black lives to matter, and right now they are being killed because of the color of their skin,” Jacelyn said.\\n\\nA Pinckneyville Police officer asked Kreid to move across the street, and he complied.\\n\\nMayor Spencer attended to make sure everything stayed peaceful. He is encouraged by the group of young people who were protesting. It was a group with different races. “We need to be on the same page, and not be white against black. It’s about justice. That’s what we need to do – work together,” he said.\\n\\nSouthern Illinoisans hold demonstrations in response to George Floyd\\'s death\\n\\n‘Sharing the love’: Demonstrators in Marion march for equality, peace\\n\\nAveon Winfield, of Grand Chain, leads a chant on Saturday, June 13, 2020, during a demonstration against racism and inequality in Marion.\\n\\nBrian Munoz\\n\\n‘Sharing the love’: Demonstrators in Marion march for equality, peace\\n\\nKorshawn Johnson, of Carterville, calls out chants on Saturday, June 13, 2020, during a march against racism and inequality in Marion.\\n\\nBrian Munoz\\n\\n‘Sharing the love’: Demonstrators in Marion march for equality, peace\\n\\nMarch organizer Elijah Burnett, of Carterville, speaks to a demonstrators on Saturday, June 13, 2020, at the end of a demonstration against racism and inequality at John W.
